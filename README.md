# ChannelMarkov

This is an experimental port of ChannelMarkov to Mastodon.

## How to run

1. **Write a configuration file.**  
   Copy `config.example.py` into `config.py`. Fill out stuff such as the channels you want to use, as well as OAuth2 information.

2. **Install dependencies.**  
   Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3. **Run the script(s).**  
   Choose either `wintuber.py` or `youtuber.py` (they behave slightly differently!), run them, and follow the instructions on screen.
